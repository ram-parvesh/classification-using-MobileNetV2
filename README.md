## 1. Intro
PyTorch Implemention of MobileNet V2

Reproduction of MobileNet V2 architecture as described in MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks by Mark Sandler, Andrew Howard, Menglong Zhu, Andrey Zhmoginov and Liang-Chieh Chen on ILSVRC2012 benchmark with PyTorch framework.

This implementation provides an example procedure of training and validating any prevalent deep neural network architecture, with modular data processing, training, logging and visualization integrated.
